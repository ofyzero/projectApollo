## Line Detection using Deep Learning

This project purpose is the predict lane on the road in realtime for self driving cars. It is using fully connected neural network model for real time predictions. 
Code is written on Python using Colab from Google. Jupyter notebook easly can be copied to Colab and can used easyly.
